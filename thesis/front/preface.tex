This thesis concludes my Master's degree in Computer Science at Aarhus University. It is with great satisfaction, that it has been done in the realm of cryptography, which itself is the reason that I wanted to study computer science in the first place. It has been a long and arduous journey, but finally I will have written a thesis and soon I will have completed my studies. This is then also the culmination of having spent 8 years at the same institution and having undertaken lots of things that were relevant to my studies and perhaps even more that were not. I am immensely grateful for all the people that I have met along the way. They must number in the hundreds if not almost thousands and have all had some sort of impact upon me. Having to leave Aarhus University seems a bit unreal. I would be lying, if I were to say, that I did not want to stay, but I must also say that I am glad to finalise my total of 21 years of education. Wish me luck and I will wish that upon you too.
